# Lab 2
In this lab we setup a pico w project. 

## Activity 1
Added the submodules and updated.

## Activity 2
All tests past when building the test executables.

## Activity 3
We decided to follow the code through from the main function and follow it down. This works because there is not a lot of code. A better approach would be needed for more complex code.

## Activity 4
Code has been commented.

## Activity 5
What will happen if vTaskStartScheduler() is deleted? Without a scheduler tasks will not run, and the code will not work. The behavior matched the prediction.

## Activity 6
See ./test/TEST.md for testing plan.

## Activity 7
Execution contexts have been minimized. See commits to follow them.

## Activity 8, 9, 10
Code was put into a few different files. We added handlers.h, handlers.c, and task_helpers.c to handle the different things tasks needed to do.

## Activity 11
Tests are built and located in the ./test directory. All tests pass.
